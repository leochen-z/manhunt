# Manhunt

Real-world hide and seek. Players join a lobby on their phones, share live GPS
positions, and seekers get distance readouts and a compass arrow pointing at
their chosen hider.

Built to keep working on **spotty internet**: the client and server talk over
Socket.IO with automatic reconnection, players who drop offline keep their
identity for 5 minutes and resume seamlessly, stale positions are labeled
instead of silently shown as live, and a service worker keeps the app shell
loading without connectivity.

## Repo layout

- Repo root — React + Vite frontend (this used to be the whole repo)
- `server/` — Express + Socket.IO backend (merged in from the old ManhuntApi repo)

## Development

```bash
npm install                  # frontend deps
npm --prefix server install  # backend deps

npm run dev:server           # API + socket server on http://localhost:3001
npm run dev                  # Vite dev server (points at localhost:3001 via .env.development)
```

## How the protocol works

- `POST /manhunt-api/create-lobby` — the only REST endpoint; returns a `lobby_id`.
- Everything else happens over one Socket.IO connection (path
  `/manhunt-api/socket.io`), authenticated with `{ lobby_id, player_token }`:
  - No token → the server creates a player and returns a token in the `joined`
    event. The client stores it in localStorage.
  - Valid token → the server **resumes** that player (name, role, player_id
    preserved). This is what makes dead zones survivable: reconnecting after
    a dropout restores the same identity.
  - Client → server: `update-location`, `update-player`, `leave-lobby` (all acked).
  - Server → clients: `lobby-state` pushed to the lobby room on any change,
    throttled to 1/second per lobby. Includes each player's
    `location_last_updated` and `connected` flag so clients can show staleness.
- A player who disconnects is marked offline (not deleted) and kept for
  **5 minutes** before removal. After that, their token is rejected and the
  client offers the rejoin flow.

## Deployment

Two options:

1. **Single origin (simplest):** `npm run build`, then run `server/server.js`
   — it serves `dist/` itself when it exists. Build with `VITE_API_ORIGIN=""`
   (empty) so the client talks to its own origin.
2. **Split hosting:** host `dist/` anywhere, build with
   `VITE_API_ORIGIN=https://your-api-host`, and set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
   env var (comma-separated) to your frontend origin.

Notes:
- Any reverse proxy in front of the server must forward WebSocket upgrade
  headers for `/manhunt-api/socket.io`. If it can't, Socket.IO automatically
  falls back to HTTP long-polling.
- Lobby state is in-memory only: restarting the server ends all live games.

## Play over the internet (ngrok)

To play with friends who aren't on your Wi-Fi, expose the whole app — frontend,
API, and websocket — through one public URL:

```bash
npm run tunnel
```

This builds for single-origin, starts the server, opens an `ngrok` tunnel to it,
and prints the public `https://…` URL. Open that on your phone, then use the
in-app **Invite** button (QR code / link) to get everyone else in.

Prerequisites: the [ngrok CLI](https://ngrok.com/download) installed and authed
once with `ngrok config add-authtoken <your-token>`.

Notes:
- ngrok's free tier shows a one-time "You are about to visit…" interstitial on
  first load — tap **Visit Site** and the app loads normally.
- The server auto-accepts tunnel origins (`*.ngrok-free.app`, `*.ngrok.app`,
  `*.ngrok-free.dev`, `*.ngrok.io`, `*.trycloudflare.com`) so a fresh random URL
  just works.

Environment knobs (server):
- `PORT` — server port (default `3001`).
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — extra comma-separated origins to allow.
- `TRUST_ALL_ORIGINS=1` — allow any origin (disables the CORS allowlist).

## Compass / device orientation (Android & iOS)

The compass arrow works across platforms via `src/hooks/useCompassHeading.js`
(pure math in `src/utils/orientation.js`, unit-tested with `npm test`):

- **iOS Safari**: uses `webkitCompassHeading` (a true clockwise heading) behind
  the iOS tap-to-grant permission prompt.
- **Android Chrome / Samsung Internet**: uses `deviceorientationabsolute`.
  Spec `alpha` is *counterclockwise* and only meaningful with tilt taken into
  account, so the heading is computed as the horizontal projection of the
  device's top axis, then screen-rotation compensated and smoothed.
- **Firefox Android**: falls back to `deviceorientation` events flagged
  `absolute: true`.
- Relative orientation events (arbitrary, drifting zero) are never used.
- Devices with no magnetometer are detected at runtime and get a cardinal
  direction fallback ("Head NE" + distance) instead of a dead arrow.

Requirements: sensors only work over **HTTPS**, and any proxy must not send a
`Permissions-Policy` header that blocks `accelerometer`, `gyroscope`, or
`magnetometer`.
